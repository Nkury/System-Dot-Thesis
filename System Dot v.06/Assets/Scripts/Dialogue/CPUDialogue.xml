    <say char="Shopkeeper">Makes sense. I can tell by its human body.</say>
    <say char="IntelliSense">You're a human, PLAYERNAME?</say>
    <say char="IntelliSense">That means you're from the outside world.</say>
    <say char="Shopkeeper">Hey, come exchange some memory at the RAM first!</say>
    <say char="Shopkeeper">You must have some top high-end memory.</say>
    <say char="IntelliSense">Shhh... here's a map. We're in the system layer.</say>

    <say char="Shopkeeper">Wait! Use your memory here before you go! Please!</say>
