    <say char="IntelliSense">WHOOAAAA! What just happened?!</say>
    <say char="Engineer">In all my days as an engineering process...</say>
    <say char="Engineer">I've never seen the ESB malfunction like that!</say>
    <say char="IntelliSense">Thank DOS we have an engineer with us!</say>
    <say char="Engineer">I'm sensing a breach in the system...</say>
    <say char="Engineer">Halt! Who in the Turing machine are you?</say>
    <say char="IntelliSense">Hold on, PLAYERNAME, I will solve this.</say>
    <say char="IntelliSense">Salutations, Variabull Engineer!</say>
    <say char="IntelliSense">1010100101010010010101001010101000100</say>
    <say char="Engineer">Huh?</say>
    <say char="IntelliSense">Shoot! That didn't work!</say>
    <say char="Engineer">Hold on a clock cycle!</say>
    <say char="Engineer">Did you say PLAYERNAME?!</say>
    <say char="IntelliSense">Uh...</say>
    <say char="Engineer">THE PLAYERNAME?!</say>
    <say char="Engineer">Oh wow, I didn't know our ancestor was here!</say>
    <say char="IntelliSense">Ancestor?</say>
    <say char="Engineer">We were created by PLAYERNAME. He is our creator.</say>
    <say char="IntelliSense">Garbage! That doesn't make sense!</say>
    <say char="Engineer">We live in System-PLAYERNAME. Of course it's true!</say>
    <say char="IntelliSense">Huh? Why didn't tell me you were the creator?!</say>
    <say char="IntelliSense">Oh right, you don't speak.</say>
    <say char="Engineer">This all makes sense now. We need to get our creator...</say>
    <say char="Engineer">...back to the outside world so he can fix this mess!</say>
    <say char="IntelliSense">Then how do we get out of here?</say>
    <say char="Engineer">I'm an address table. I manage variabulls.</say>
    <say char="Engineer">... and some of them are stuck somewhere here.</say>
    <say char="Engineer">They hold some valuable information that we need.</say>
    <say char="Engineer">I need to stay here and try to repair the ESB.</say>
    <say char="Engineer">Can you two go find my FOUR variabulls?</say>
    <say char="IntelliSense">Ugghhhh... we just got out of danger...</say>
    <say char="IntelliSense">Let's go, PLAYERNAME!</say>
